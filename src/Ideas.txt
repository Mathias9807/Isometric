A mix between Red Alert, Tribal Wars and Lego Battles. The player is in control of a kingdom and they have to protect it from other kingdoms. 

Buildings

	Entities that never move but provide functionality or increased stats to the kingdom, e.g. a normal house can increase the population cap, a wall that hinders enemies etc. 
	
	Every kingdom has a main building where the king resides. 
	
	The population affects how many soldiers the kingdom can have but they require housing and food from farms. 
	
	Buildings are built by builders. They cost a certain amount of materials to create and take time to build. There are two ways to destroy a building: 
		-Burning: You can burn a building to quickly destroy it, this will give minimal resources back. 
		-Disassemble: You can disassemble a building to get all resources back however this takes a while. 

People
	
	Entities that do move around and can accomplish various tasks, e.g. a soldier can fight enemies, a farmer can improve food supplies, a builder can build things. 
	
	When a person is created they spawn next to the building that created them. 
	
	Some people could wander around the houses, they wouldn't have a real effect but they would help make the world feel alive. 

Game Mechanics
	
	Food
		
		If the kingdom has more people than they can give food the people will slowly diminish until the food is enough. 
		Attacking the kingdoms farms would be very effective at weakening the kingdom. 
		
		Food is gained by building farms. Farms will give a small amount of food on their own but if a person is assigned to a farm it will give more and more food. 
		Farms should take up a lot of space and should be expensive to protect. 
	
	AI
		
		The AI should be able to build a kingdom of their own and attack your kingdom.
